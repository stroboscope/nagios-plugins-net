"The generic NAT module is net/netfilter/nf_nat_core.c. 
The basic elements of the NAT implementation are the nf_nat_l4proto structure
(include/net/netfilter/nf_nat_l4proto.h) and the nf_nat_l3proto structure. 
In kernels prior to 3.7, you will encounter the nf_nat_protocol structure 
instead of these two structures, which replaced them as part of adding 
IPv6 NAT support. These two structures provide a protocol-independent NAT 
core support."
